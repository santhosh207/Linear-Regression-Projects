# Bangalore House Price Prediction


## About
This project is basically a supervised machine learning model. We have used multiple linear regression to build the model. We have a data set containing various attributes which depend on the price of the house. We use those attributes to predict the price of the house.

### Attributes which depends on house price
* Area of the house
* BHK of the house
* Number of bath rooms
* Location of the house
Our target variable will be predicting the accurate price of the house.





## Tech Stack

* Python
* Flask
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
## Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Sklearn
* Linear Regression


## Code

The main code of the project is present in the ipynb nodebook called data_science_project.ipynb. The actual code and the functionality can be seen there.

### Steps

* Import various libraries.
* Extract the dataset.
* Data Cleaning on the dataset.
* Exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
* Use a suitable machine learning model.
* Fit the model.
* Test the model by user given inputs.
* Finally check the accuracy of the model.
## Demo

* This is the basic user interface of the project. The user has to enter various attributes like area of the house, BHK of the house, number of bath rooms, location of the house.
* Then after clicking the predict button the user will be able to predict the accuate price of the house.
